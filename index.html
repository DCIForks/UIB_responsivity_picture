      <p>
        A clockwork mechanism is often powered by a clockwork motor consisting
        of a mainspring, a spiral torsion spring of metal ribbon. Energy is
        stored in the mainspring manually by winding it up, turning a key
        attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter. Then the
        force of the mainspring turns the clockwork gears, until the stored
        energy is used up. The adjectives <em>wind-up</em> and
        <em>spring-powered</em> refer to mainspring-powered clockwork devices,
        which include clocks and watches, kitchen timers, music boxes, and
        wind-up toys.
